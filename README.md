# Homework-1-ADM
In the folder hw1 there are 3 folders, one for each problem assigned, and a PDF "submission.pdf".

The "submission.pdf" file contains all my submission done on HackerRank. It contains both Problem 1 and 2 submission because i didn't solved them following their order.

In the folder "prob 1" there is a file "scripts.py" that contains all my solutions to the excercises of the Problem 1 and there is a pdf containing all the submission

In the folder "prob 2" there is a file "scripts.py" that contains my solutions for Problem 2 assignments.
